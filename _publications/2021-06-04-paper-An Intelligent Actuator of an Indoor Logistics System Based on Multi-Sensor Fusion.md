Integration technologies of artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous vehicles play important roles in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In order to achieve better logistics distribution efficiency, this paper proposes an intelligent actuator of an indoor logistics system by fusing multiple involved sensors. Firstly, an actuator based on a four-wheel differential chassis is equipped with sensors, including an RGB camera, a lidar and an indoor inertial navigation system, by which autonomous driving can be realized. Secondly, cross-floor positioning can be realized by multi-node simultaneous localization and mappings (SLAM) based on the Cartographer algorithm Thirdly the actuator can communicate with elevators and take the elevator to the designated delivery floor. Finally, a novel indoor route planning strategy is designed based on an A* algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) and an actual building is tested as a scenario. The experimental results have shown that the actuator can model the indoor mapping and develop the optimal route effectively. At the same time, the actuator displays its superiority in detecting the dynamic obstacles and actively avoiding the collision in the indoor scenario. Through communicating with indoor elevators, the final delivery task can be completed accurately by autonomous driving.
