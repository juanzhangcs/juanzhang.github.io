 Multimedia transmission plays a dominant role in today’s telecommunications, and one of the primary metrics is Quality of Service (QoS) which concentrates on the mobile devices and services without customers’ experience. Besides, it is also necessary to reduce energy consumption of the service delivery. To optimize the trade-off between users’ satisfying experience and energy efficiency, Quality of Experience (QoE) has become an important metric to be considered. However, QoE can be hardly measured in wireless network due to its unique communication characteristics, especially constrained energy. In this paper, we first present definitions of QoE with its essential characteristics in multimedia transmission. Then we discuss the existing approaches for achieving QoE-aware and energy efficient video transmission from different perspectives such as resource allocation, traffic buffering and other scheduling strategies. Future challenges on the trade-off between QoE aware and energy-efficient solutions are also discussed.
