It is agreed that connected vehicle technologies have broad implications to traffic management systems. In order to alleviate urban congestion and improve road capacity, this paper proposes a multilane spatiotemporal trajectory optimization method (MSTTOM) to reach full potential of connected vehicles by considering vehicular safety, traffic capacity, fuel efficiency, and driver comfort. In this MSTTOM, the dynamic characteristics of connected vehicles, the vehicular state vector, the optimized objective function, and the constraints are formulated. The method for solving the trajectory problem is optimized based on Pontryaginâ€™s maximum principle and reinforcement learning (RL). A typical scenario of intersection with a one-way 4-lane section is measured, and the data within 24 hours are collected for tests. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can optimize the traffic flow by enhancing vehicle fuel efficiency by 32% and reducing pollutants emissions by 17% compared with the advanced glide path prototype application (GPPA) scheme.
