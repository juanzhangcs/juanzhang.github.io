 Advancement in the novel technology of connected vehicles has presented opportunities and challenges for smart urban transport and land use. To improve the capacity of urban transport and optimize land-use planning, a novel real-time regional route planning model based on vehicle to X communication (V2X) is presented in this paper. First, considering the traffic signal timing and phase information collected by V2X, road section resistance values are calculated dynamically based on real-time vehicular driving data. Second, according to the topology structure of the current regional road network, all predicted routes are listed based on the Dijkstra algorithm. Third, the predicted travel time of each alternative route is calculated, while the predicted route with the least travel time is selected as the optimal route. Finally, we design the test scenario with different traffic saturation levels and collect 150 sets of data to analyze the feasibility of the proposed method. The numerical results have shown that the average travel times calculated by the proposed optimal route are 8.97 seconds, 12.54 seconds, and 21.85 seconds, which are much shorter than the results of traditional navigation routes. This proposed model can be further applied to the whole urban traffic network and contribute to a greater transport and land-use efficiency in the future.
